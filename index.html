            <p class=intro>I have lived in Canada about <mark>two years</mark>. My birthday is April 29<sup>th</sup> When I decided to learn English, I needed to choose the country where I wanted to learn English.
            I was fascinated to go to Canada because I wanted to see <em>aurora</em>. 
            However, I have not seen yet, so I am going to see the aurora next Winter if COVID-19 would disappear.
            One of my hobby is exercising.</p>
            <p>I like doing Pilates and going gym. I used to exercise three times a week, but I have not been the gym about 8months due to COVID-19. 
                Therefore, I cannot wait to do activities as before.I have recently a new hobby is <strong>baking</strong>. I sometimes bake muffins, cookies and Croissants.</p>
